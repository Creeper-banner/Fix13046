# Fix13046

This mods fixes [MC-13046](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-13046) for MC 1.7.10, which causes words after certain characters (most commonly the left full-width brackets "（" ) disappear, resulting in annoying "shattered" texts and confusing players sometimes.

The mod implements a simple mixin to fix this.

The workspace is generally forked from GTNH's example mod repo.
